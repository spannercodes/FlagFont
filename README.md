# FlagFont
An 8x8 Minecraft country &amp; pride flag font. Based upon [MCPrideEmojis](https://github.com/spannerdev/MCPrideEmojis)

## Usage
Run `generator.py` using Python 3 (old versions may break).

The font resource will be located in the `assets/` folder. You can copy this into the server resource pack to send it to the client. The generator will not create a `pack.mcmeta` file for you.

The Java class is located in the `src/` folder (specifically `src/main/java/resources/com/spanner/flagfont/FlagFont.java`). Future versions may change this so that it can be more easily depended upon in other projects.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! For flags, please follow the same format (even for countries with differently shaped flags) and try to use accurate colours where possible.
