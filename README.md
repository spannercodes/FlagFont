# FlagFont
An 8x8 Minecraft country &amp; pride flag font.

![flagfont](https://github.com/spannerdev/FlagFont/assets/20228769/9134409c-697d-462b-bf14-4e496777a5e5)

## Usage
Run `generator.py` using Python 3 (old versions may break).

The font resource will be located in the `assets/` folder. You can copy this into the server resource pack to send it to the client. The generator will not create a `pack.mcmeta` file for you.

The classes can now be accessed using Maven. Add the repository `https://mvn.spnr.dev/releases` and the dependency `implementation("dev.spnr:flagfont:VERSION_HERE")`

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! For flags, please follow the same format (even for countries with differently shaped flags) and try to use accurate colours where possible.
